        <p style="font-size:16px">Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
            the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
            yellow sun.

            Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
            is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
            descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
            think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

            This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
            of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
            Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
            were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces
            of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small
            green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

            And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
            most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

            Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
            mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And
            some suggested that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no
            one should ever have left the oceans.

            a girl sitting on her own in a
            small cafe in Rickmansworth England suddenly realized what it was that
            had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the
            world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
            right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
            anything.

            Sadly, however, before she could get to a telephone to tell anyone
            about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea
            was lost forever.

            This is not her story.

            But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some
            of its consequences.

            It is also the story of a book. A book called The Hitch Hiker's
            Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on
            Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or even
            heard of by any Earthman.

            Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.

            It is, perhaps, the most remarkable book ever to come out
            of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no
            Earthman had ever heard either.

            And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Easterni
            Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted
            the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of
            all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
            contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,
            it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important
            respects.

            First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words
            Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.

            But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its
            extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these
            consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable
            book begins very simply.

            It begins with a house</p>
